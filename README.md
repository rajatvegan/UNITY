# MY FIRST PROJECT

This is my first project, I created this for practicing DevOps tools. I used many different DevOps tools and AWS Cloud with this project. This project is a monolithic Flask web app with MySQL and MongoDB databases. This project is a great place to practice DevOps and AWS Cloud.

Main features of this project:

- Join a form to fill out data and save it to a MySQL database.
- View the data saved in the MySQL database.
- Add AI chatbot with prompts configured for activism.
- Deployed the app multiple times on AWS tools like Elastic Beanstalk,code deploy, ECS, EKS using AWS CodePipeline.
- Currently deployed on Render (PaaS cloud provider) managed platform.

You can open this app by clicking on [Open this app](https://rajatvegan.onrender.com/)

This project is a great place to practice DevOps and AWS Cloud. I hope you like it!
